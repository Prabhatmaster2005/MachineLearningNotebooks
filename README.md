# Machine Learning Notebooks

## A repository which holds all of my machine learning notebooks

*All the notebooks are used to predict the next few elemnts based on the data provided*

**For example:**

The correlation between the age and the fee of the player based on EPL 2019/20 season transfers [here](https://github.com/Thesavagecoder7784/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/MachineLearningAge%26fee.ipynb)

***I have created the using pandas,numpy and sklearn***

### Notebooks which have been created using Jupyter notebooks to predict and analyse sets of data:

  -Flight time delay
  
  -Increase of Salary based on years of experience
  
  -Increase in transfer fee based on age
  
  -Relation between cricket chirps and temperature
